### Changed

- Can now specify `pip` as a conda dependency. This is needed for cases that
  there are no pip dependencies in the environment, but you want it there for
  installing local packages. This may be the case if using `conda-lock` on an
  environment. Note that, much like python is always first in the dependency
  list, pip is always last.
