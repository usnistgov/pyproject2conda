### Added

- Added [PEP 735](https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/) support. This includes
  adding option `--group` to the cli, and `groups` key to
  `tools.pyproject2conda.envs....` tables. There is also an option
  `--extra-or-group` (or `extras_or_groups` in pyproject.toml) that will first
  try to find dependencies from "extras" and then from "groups".

### Changed

- Passing no extras to an environment now defaults to no added extras or groups.
  Old behavior (to default to the extra with the same name as the environment)
  was lead to complications with support of `dependency-groups`. Explicitly pass
  the extra or group if to get the old behavior.
- `default_envs` now passed the environment name as `extras_or_groups`.
  Therefore, if the name of the environment is an extra, it will be used.
  Otherwise, it will be from a group of that name.
