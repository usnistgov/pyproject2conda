### Added

- Now use `logging` to print info output.

### Changed

- cli now uses `typer`. Since the program was already typed, this simplifies the
  interface.
- Program can now be called with any of `pyproject2conda`, `p2c`, or
  `python -m pyproject2conda`.
- Added cli options to web documentation.
- Fixed small typos and typing issues.
- The cli option `--python-include` now requires an argument. This is due to
  `typer` not liking options with zero or one arguments. Instead of the bare
  flag `--python-include` including the python spec from `pyproject.toml`, you
  have to pass `--python-include infer` to get that behavior.
- Added extra `all` to pip install options. The default is to not include `rich`
  or `shellingham`. Using `pip install pyproject2conda[all]` includes these
  optional packages. Note that the conda-forge recipe is based on the plain
  install (i.e., no `rich` or `shellingham`). However, the conda-froge recipe
  for `typer` does include these. That means, if you want to install
  `pyproject2conda` without the optional extras, you'll have to use pip.
